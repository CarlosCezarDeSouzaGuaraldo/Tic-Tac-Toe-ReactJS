# Tic Tac Toe in ReactJS

Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe repository built with ReactJS! Here's a brief overview of the project and instructions on how to run it.

## About the Project

In this project, I developed a Tic Tac Toe game using ReactJS and JavaScript. Throughout the development, I explored key React concepts including:
`elements`,
`components`,
`props`,
`state`.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have `Node.js` installed on your machine. The version I used to develop this project was `v18.12.1`.

## Project Setup

1. To start the project, I created a new React app using the following command in the terminal:

``` shell
$ npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe-reactjs
```

2. After creating the project, navigate to the project's root directory using the command:

``` shell
$ cd tic-tac-toe-reactjs
```

3. To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command in the terminal:

``` shell
$ npm install
```

## Running the Application

To start the application, use the following command:

``` shell
$ npm start
```

The application will be running, and you can access it in your preferred browser using the address: `http://localhost:3000/` and **LET'S PLAY!**.
